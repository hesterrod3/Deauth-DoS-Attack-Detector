# Deauth DoS Attack Detector

> Developed and maintained by **Rodney Hester**

This is a simple yet effective Python-based tool designed to **detect Deauthentication (Deauth) DoS attacks** targeting WiFi networks.

Such attacks are common in wireless environments where an attacker sends deauthentication frames to disconnect users from a network. This tool monitors and alerts for such malicious activities.
